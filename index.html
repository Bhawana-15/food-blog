            For many people, eating healthy is a chore. When the world is filled with glorious <br>
            pastas, the cheesiest of pizzas, and layers of cake, why in the world would we ever<br>
            bother eating a salad? Well, fellow gluttons, it's because not only is it a good idea<br>
            for us to eat a vegetable every now in then, but also eating healthy is actually<br>
            delicious -- no lie.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you don't know where to begin when it comes to making healthy food choices -<br>
            - or if you are already following a healthy, wholesome diet but need some new<br>
            recipe ideas -- we have gathered together our 10 favorite blogs to turn to for<br>
            fresh, seasonal, whole-grain cooking (and baking). These bloggers will make you<br>
            forget all about the allure of double stuffed Oreos and kettle chips. Or at the very<br>
            least, they'll make eating salads feel like a treat.

            Eating a healthy, balanced diet is one of the most important things you can<br>
            do to protect your health. In fact, up to 80% of premature heart disease and<br>
            stroke can be prevented through your life choices and habits, such as<br>
            eating a healthy diet and being physically active.<br>
